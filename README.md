# DatasToolbox
This package used to contain tools for doing all sorts of data manipulation, preprocessing and conversion (especially from python formats).  Now but a shell of its former glory (in an almost literaly sense), the package simply re-exports functions from the packages to which its old functionality has been moved.  See [DataHandlers.jl](https://github.com/ExpandingMan/DataHandlers.jl), [DataUtils.jl](https://github.com/ExpandingMan/DataUtils.jl) and [PyConversions.jl](https://github.com/ExpandingMan/PyConversions.jl) (the last of these is not exported from DatasToolbox).
