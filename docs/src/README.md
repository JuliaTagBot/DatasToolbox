# DatasToolbox

This is a set of tools for performing common, generic manipulations on data, primarily for 
machine learning and optimization.  It also contains a set of tools for easily converting
from Python in a type-correct way.

Note that there is currently a bug in the documentation generator that causes it to also
list private methods.  All such methods have names that start with `_`.
